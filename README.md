## Assignment 2: Guess-The-Song webgame
By: Afiq Ashriq , Goh Jia Dong

This webpage project is a platform that revists old music classics through a series of kahoot-style games that ranges from different genres and difficulties. This project encourages user to be educated in pop-culture by rewarding points for each corrrect answer and achievements. There will be three difficulties that will make it more fun.

## The game: 
    5 different songs will be played, each time the user will have a time limit to pick the correct song
    title. With each correct answer, points and will be awarded to the user.

## Design Process:
Who is the website for: Our target audience for this webgame are individuals who want to have fun and expand their music knowledege. This game will expose the users to different songs from different genres and timelines.
 - As a user, I would want the website to be easy to navigate.
 - As a user, I would want the website to have a nice look.
 - As a user, i would want to be rewarded for advancing far into the webgame, so i want probably want a reward/achievement system.
 - As a user, i want to be able to save my progress for the next time i log in, so i want to save my information somewhere.
 - As a competitive user, i want the webgame to be progressive and challenging, so i want different 'levels' to the game.

design rationale
- We chose purple as it fits in with who we want our audience to be. We want our game to be played by anyone not only children so purple is a perfect colour for us. Our purple is a mix of light and dark, if it were other colours it would either look too boring or too kiddish.
- We have different fonts mainly a pixelated font to remind the users that it is a game, and our second font is a sort of stylish font that fits in nicely with our theme of "Music".
