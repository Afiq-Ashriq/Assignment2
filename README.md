This project encourages user to be educated in pop-culture by rewarding in-game points that are exchangable for rewards and also scaling difficulties that excites competitive players.

## The game: 
    5 different songs will be played, each time the user will have a time limit to pick the correct song
    title. With each correct answer, points and coins will be awarded to redeem items.

## Design Process:
Who is the website for: Our target audience for this webgame are individuals who want to have fun and expand their music knowledege. This game will expose the users to different songs from different genres and timelines.
 - As a user, I would want the website to be easy to navigate.
 - As a user, I would want the website to have a nice look.
 - As a user, i would want to be rewarded for advancing far into the webgame, so i want probably want a reward/achievement system.
 - As a user, i want to be able to save my progress for the next time i log in, so i want to save my information somewhere.
 - As a competitive user, i want the webgame to be progressive and challenging, so i want different 'levels' to the game.
